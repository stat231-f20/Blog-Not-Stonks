## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#replace with your location of file
#t=Year, k=Product category (HS 6-digit code), i=Exporter (ISO 3-digit country code)
#j=Importer (ISO 3-digit country code), v=Value of the trade flow (in thousands current USD)
#q=Quantity (in metric tons)
tradedata2018 <- read.csv("/Users/samassaf1/Desktop/Data Science/sam's 231 git/Blog-Not-Stonks/Data/trade_2018_hs17.csv")

#replace with your location of file
#3-digit country code
countrycodes <- read.csv("/Users/samassaf1/Desktop/Data Science/sam's 231 git/Blog-Not-Stonks/Data/country_codes.csv")

#replace with your location of file
#6-digit code
productcodes <- read.csv("/Users/samassaf1/Desktop/Data Science/sam's 231 git/Blog-Not-Stonks/Data/product_codes_hs17.csv")
